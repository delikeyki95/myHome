        <p class="inner-paragraph">
          When subscribing to become a Member, you must designate an e-mail address because it is needed when you use Chemtopia websites and engage in activities. Chemtopia will accept your e-mail address as your authentic e-mail address.

        <h3>1.2 Members Passwords</h3>
        <p class="inner-paragraph">
          Even Chemtopia’s staff cannot identify the passwords of Members because Chemtopia strictly safeguards and manages private information (by encrypting the information, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Wrong Information Submitted in the Course of Membership Subscription</h3>
        <p class="inner-paragraph">
          Please check if you are already a Member of Chemtopia, if you see a message that says the submitted e-mail address belongs to an existing Member, while subscribing for Membership. If you are not a Member of Chemtopia at the time, the submitted e-mail address might have been stolen by others. In such case, please contact us at the <a href="http://www.chemtopia.com/help/contactus" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> section of the Chemtopia website. Chemtopia will review your inquiry, and take appropriate action.

            <li>discussions on religious topics which are irrelevant to chemistry, or general slander on religions shall be avoided;</li>
            <li>any posting that mentions a person’s name must be backed by indisputable evidence of the person’s identity;</li>
            <li>
              any statement that exposes another person’s personal information will be deleted;

        <h3>Raising Objections with Regards to Contents Posted on Chemtopia Websites</h3>
        <p class="inner-paragraph">
          Chemtopia respects intellectual property rights of others, and strives to maintain an infringement-free website. Members must make accurate and legal postings that comply with the Chemtopia Terms of Service, and such postings must not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party. Thus, Chemtopia has established a set of procedures for objecting to potentially copyright-infringing content in a Member’s post. Please refer to the following provisions to find out more about Chemtopia’s policies and procedures related to how copyrights are handled:<br /><br />
          Chemtopia may take any reasonable, good faith action to deliver a written notice to any member accused of posting copyright-infringing content.  This notification would include contact details of the person who raised an objection. Chemtopia may choose to suspend or delete the piece of content from being accessed.  Chemtopia will place restrictions on or suspend a Member’s account, if the Member make postings which infringe or are likely to infringe others’ rights repeatedly, and other illegal contents. These actions would be taken following the applicable policies of Chemtopia under applicable circumstances at Chemtopia’s appropriate discretion.<br /><br />
          Please note that a notice or response a user submits must be trustworthy, and the user will be subjected to punishment if the notice or response contains any false statement. A user may become legally liable for any false notice or response, and Chemtopia recommends the user to seek for legal advices before sending or responding to a notice.
